# This file has some sample data if you want to manually add some blacklist entries for ya-malware-block.
# This file is totally optional, and the script will work just fine without this blacklist file present.
# You can put comment lines just like this, but do not put in-line comments (comments in the same line as IP or CIDR data)

# Manually added discrete IPs to blacklist

# Manually added CIDR ranges to blacklist
